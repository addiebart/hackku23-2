# Space World 2000

## Inspiration
_Space World 2000_--named after the [Nintendo event of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Space_World)--is a tech demo inspired by, and prominently feeling like, early, CGA-era MS-DOS games, ala [_Space Quest III_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_III).
## What it does
By no means is _Space World 2000_ a complete game, rather it is a display of our newly found competence, now that we are comfortable with the technology.
## How we built it
We employed an amazing 2D graphics JS library called [Phaser](https://phaser.io/), hosting static files through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and collaborating through a discretionary understanding of [Git](https://git-scm.org/). 
## Challenges we ran into
A big time sink for us was getting typing to work properly in VSCode. Phaser makes liberal use of the 'this' keyword, confusing IDEs in terms of IntelliSense. We tried multiple remedies including TypeScript, but found it difficult to collaborate with an increasingly bloated stack. We ended up ditching TS for increased productivity.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
First and foremost, we think we should feel at least some accomplished for finishing with a coherent, presentable project. Beyond that, though, we're proud of the manner in which we were able to collaborate and adapt as a team. 
## What we learned
We learned a lot about the technologies that we used and became familiar with this weekend. We also learned that code rarely works on it's own. In a video game--requiring art, music, and direction--this is fore-frontally obvious, but the premise applies to other applications the same, perhaps relying on infosec and user intent instead.
## What's next for Space World 2000
The most clear step would be to lean more heavily into design and other creative elements, as opposed the purely technical ones we spent so much of our time on. Increased art quality, sound design, etc. With modern web APIs, even [gamepad support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API)  would make for a good prospect.
## Note
 A landscape screen and keyboard are required.<br>
 Space World 2000 was make with love for HackKU23 by Addie, Hunter, Tommy, and Ayna.
